* Sevent: fast and simple async io
Sevent is a small library on top of mio that provides a callback/handler based API for asynchronous IO.

Mio is a nice low-level library, and gives a lot of flexibility on how to structure your application.
In many cases, specially when prototyping, that flexibility ends up costing more than it gives.
Sevent makes most of the choices for you, so you can focus on the application.

Sevent provides:
- one global event loop per thread => no tracking and passing an event loop around
- handler/callback based event handling => no need to store or track io objects yourself
- connection io and buffer handling => sevent call's you back when data is available and writes it out when needed
- timeout events
- channel events

Sevent also provides a very simple to use framed protocol using serde/bincode.
