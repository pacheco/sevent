* avoid registering for writes
  Right now we always schedule writes in the evloop, to avoid
  reentrancy in the connection handler.

  Can we do better? Some ideas:
  1) Maybe calls to write should "schedule" the write to happen outside the handler?
  2) What if handler calls were scheduled and executed later?
